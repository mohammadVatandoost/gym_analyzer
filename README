Research about:
    - Angle noise redution
    - Bidirectional RNN/LSTM
    - can we use feature embedding for keypoints? like feature embedding for words in nlp( apple and orange is similar).
    we can use CNN for arms and then give the output to LSTM.
    -  what should be the NN input? Angles of keypoints, keypoints and visibility of keypoints, keypoints feature embedding
